### Who is represented in the matching data?
Currently, the SQS is focused on providing data from Internal Revenue Service Administrative Tax Records. This includes information returns from all workers receiving W-2s and independent contractors receiving 1099s, as well as 1040s from self employed or business income. However, earnings from self-employment by individuals who did not file a tax return will not be included. Data is only updated annually and will not include quarter by quarter wage reports. 


### How current are the IRS data youâ€™re matching to?
IRS data is updated from annual tax records on a yearly basis, and we expect data from the previous calendar year to be available for matching each August.


### Do the aggregate data that I get back include demographic information?
No, the data does not include demographic information; it will be aggregate statistics such as xyz, but you may choose which demographic information in your submitted data you want to sort by/to match income by demographic characteristics.


### What other data are available aside from earnings statistics?
Currently only earnings data from the IRS are available, though we hope to expand to other sources of federal government data in the future, such as NDNH and Census data.


### Can I share the data with others on my team or the public? 
Yes, the data you receive back from the SQS will be suitable for sharing both internally and to the public with no greater restrictions than those you have placed on your original input data. 


### What technical skills do I need to have to use the interface?
Basic data processing and analysis skills are needed to ensure your data is in the correct format to submit to the SQS, though our Wizard ðŸ§™ will help walk you through this process to ensure it is as easy as possible. If youâ€™re already working with your data, you have the skills. When you receive your results, additional statistical skills may be needed to get the most out of interpreting them.
