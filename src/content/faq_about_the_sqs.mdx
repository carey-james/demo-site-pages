### What is the SQS?
The Statistical Querry Service is an opportunity for researchers at schools, public organizations, and other policy hubs to easily and safely add aggregated employment and earnings data from the federal government to the data they already have. If you are at such an organization, you can securely send Georgetown, the intermediary for the project, your data, which will then be formatted and sent on to the Internal Revenue Service, who will match it to their earnings data and send summary information back through Georgetown to you. Georgetown helps make this process possible for researchers as well as providing resources to make it easier for you to understand the results you receive.


### Who are targeted users of the SQS? 
Anyone at a not-for-profit or government entity who is evaluating an educational, social services, or similar program. The SQS is NOT for for-profit businesses or universities, marketing purposes, surveillance, law enforcement, or individual use.


### How can the SQS help me?
The SQS can fill in critical gaps in your knowledge about your data subjects by providing federal earnings and employment data to augment your existing data. This data has the potential to help with program planning and evaluation of policies by tracking results of educational initiatives and like projects down the road. Because the data is federal, it will include individuals who may be missed in any state specific data you have access to, such as individuals who have moved across state lines. 


### What phases of the SQS are planned? 
The SQS will initially serve as a link between the IRS and a select group of pilot organizations who request data matches under Georgetown and Yale’s coordination. Georgetown’s Massive Data Institute will serve as the temporary intermediary during this phase. In the future, the system will be opened to include other federal data from different organizations, be accessible to a wider range of users, and may be run by an independent intermediary for long-term service, such as the National Secure Data Service.


### Who are your partners?
The SQS is a collaboration between Georgetown University’s Massive Data Institute, Yale University’s Tobin Center for Economic Policy, the Internal Revenue Service, and you!
