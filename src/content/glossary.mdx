##### Masking
The substitution of a predetermined symbol for a particular cell, used in order to prevent disclosure.


##### MD5
A popular Secure Hashing algorithm that performs a functionally one-way conversion of a string of text into a hashed value. One application is for two actors to compare the MD5 values generated by passing the datasets through the algorithm to determine whether they have identical datasets without disclosing any aspect of their data.


##### Metadata
Information about how a given dataset was collected, digitized, processed, evaluated, or otherwise came into its current form.

##### Perturbation
A (typically small) change to an existing datapoint, often intended to aid in anonymization.
