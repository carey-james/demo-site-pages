This is the file format wizard! It will help let you know if your files are in the correct format for submission to the SQS!


**File Format Instructions:**
* Files must be a CSV.
* Files must be pipe-delineated ('|').
* Files must have the first eight (8) columns reserved for the following data:


`Partner ID | Tax Year | Social Security Number | First Name | Middle Initial | Last Name | State | ZIP Code`


* Columns after the first eight columns may contain whatever variables you would like your earning data collated by.
* Partner ID and Tax Year are required, all other variables are optional, but ***without either Social Security Number*** **or** ***Name and Location variables probability of matching is very low.***
* Leave blank columns empty, do not change the number of columns.
